## To start:
### - download the repository from GH
### - open backend folder
### - run "npm start" in terminal
### - open frontend folder
### - run "npm start" in terminal


## Notes
### Was able to implement frontend design with MaterialUI, React usage, React routing, and state managment.
### Started the backend and was able to get database connection working, but was unable to get frontend and backend working together in time allotted.  Also was unable to implement JWT authentication in time allotted.  Thank you very much for this opportunity!
